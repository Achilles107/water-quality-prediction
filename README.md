## Setup

To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## Usage

To explore and run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Achilles107/water_quality_prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd water_quality_prediction
```

3. Open the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook water_quality_prediction.ipynb
```

The notebook contains all the steps from data loading to model evaluation. Follow the cells sequentially to understand the workflow.

## Results
The results of the project include data visualizations, model performance metrics, and insights derived from the data. Key findings and model evaluations are documented in the notebook.
